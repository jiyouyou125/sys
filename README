These are images of 4 ITS backup tapes containing lisp machine source
code.  This is an early snapshot from the MIT AI labs, about the time
Symbolics was formed.  This software is designed to run on the CADR
lisp machine.  The system version of this software is "46".

This software is licensed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Please read the LICENSE file.

The tapes are labeled:

	Lisp Machine System Software
	Reel 1,2,3,4 10/17/81	
	9 track - 800bpi	
	ITS dump format	

To read them you need to :

1) convert them from their existing format to "simh" format
2) use 'itstar' to extract the files

Programs to do this are included.

Note that the tape2 is "damaged" because the first block is unreable.
We forward spaced file and then bsf'd and bsr'd (backspace record)
about 40 times and then started the image program.  In order to make
itstar happy I spliced 20 bytes on the front of it (see tpc2simh.c).
I believe we only lost one file, a SUDS file for the chaosnet board.

I am working to recover this tape and hope to have a fixed image
shortly.

Credits:

I would like to thank Tom Knight for working with the PTO office at
MIT to secure permission to release these tape.  Howard Shrobe was
very helpful and encouraging.  Richard Greenblatt answered a lot of
dumb questions and let me look in his garage.  Danial Weinreb found
the tapes in his basement and provided some helpful insights.
